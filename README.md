# sandbox
A place for imperfect experiments. Always a work-in-progress.

# Running

To run the javascript tests:
```
cd js-test-harness
npm install
npm run test
```

The whole reason I built this harness was so I could use Chrome DevTools. To do that:
```
npm run test-browser
```
In a browser, visit
file:///Users/<USERNAME>/src/sandbox/js-test-harness/test/runner.html
(Maybe broken.)
